         PREFACE  <br>
         As the White Doves came from Babylon or the Meleagrian  <br>
         Birds from the farther Νile, so over the sea and the islands  <br>
         came Eastern legends and Eastern names. And our Aryan  <br>
         studies must not blind us to the presence in an Aryan tongue  <br>
         οf these immigrants from Semitic and Egyptian speech, or  <br>
         from the nameless and forgotten lannguage that was spoken  <br>
         by the gods.  <br>
